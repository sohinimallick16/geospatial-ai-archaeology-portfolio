# NDVI Temporal Change Analysis ‚Äì Archaeological Site of Hampi, India

This project analyzes **seasonal vegetation change** around the Hampi Group of Monuments (UNESCO World Heritage Site) using multi-temporal NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Introduction

Temporal NDVI analysis is a valuable method in archaeological remote sensing. Vegetation patterns change across seasons, and this variability can reveal:

- Differences in **vegetation cover** affecting visibility of surface features
- **Human-altered zones** like ancient water management systems or fields
- **Optimal times** for UAV mapping or excavation

By comparing NDVI during dry and wet seasons, we can pinpoint areas where vegetation patterns fluctuate dramatically ‚Äî potentially masking or revealing archaeological features.

This workflow can support:

- Non-invasive monitoring of site conditions
- Planning excavation or drone survey windows
- Detecting agricultural legacy systems and site boundaries

## üìç Study Area

- **Location**: Hampi, Karnataka, India
- **Coordinates**: approx. 15.3350¬∞ N, 76.4619¬∞ E
- **AOI**: Manually drawn rectangle enclosing major monuments, tanks, and topographical features

---

## üéØ Objective

To calculate NDVI for two different dates (wet and dry season), compute the difference, and visualize vegetation dynamics that may impact archaeological site analysis.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Data Used

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Sentinel-2 (L2A) | Band 4 (Red) and Band 8 (NIR), 10m resolution |
| GeoJSON AOI | Custom polygon boundary around Hampi core zone |

- **Dry season image**: 2024-02-05
- **Wet season image**: 2024-05-30

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

- QGIS (AOI definition, initial clipping)
- Python 3.8+
  - `rasterio`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

---

## üîÑ Workflow

1. Download Sentinel-2 images from [Sentinel Hub EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/)
2. Clip Band 4 and Band 8 to AOI using QGIS
3. Compute NDVI for:
   - Dry season
   - Wet season
4. Subtract NDVI (Wet - Dry) to get temporal change map
5. Generate histograms and color maps for interpretation

## üß© Scripts Overview

This project is organized for modularity and reuse. The following scripts are used:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ndvi_calculator.py` | Contains functions to calculate NDVI and the difference between two NDVI rasters using Sentinel-2 Band 4 and Band 8. |
| `ndvi_visualise.py` | Contains `visualize_ndvi()` function to render and export NDVI maps with consistent color scales and titles. |
| `paths_to_data_results.py` | Centralized file that defines paths to all input/output files (e.g., data, results). Keeps code clean and reusable. |
| `ndvi_generate.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook to calculate NDVI for wet and dry seasons and compute their difference. |
| `ndvi_analyse.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook to visualize NDVI outputs (maps and histograms) using consistent color schemes. |

## üß≠ Relevance to Archaeology

Seasonal NDVI change supports archaeologists by:

- Highlighting **vegetation-obscured structures** during monsoon or dry periods
- Revealing **former agricultural zones** through patterns of regrowth
- Helping **schedule surveys or UAV flights** for maximum visibility
- Supporting **long-term heritage monitoring** and environmental impact assessments

This workflow can be adapted for any site with seasonal dynamics, particularly in monsoon-influenced regions like South India.
